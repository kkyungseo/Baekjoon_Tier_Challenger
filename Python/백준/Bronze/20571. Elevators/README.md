### 문제 설명

<p>Whenever a new building is built, it must comply with all the relevant building regulations. In particular, there are rules governing the number of elevators a building must have depending on its number of floors and zoning district.</p>

<p>If a building has only one floor, it doesn't need any elevators; otherwise, it needs more elevators the more floors it has, and the exact number depends on its zoning district. The following tables describe the number of elevators necessary for a building in each of the residential, commercial, and industrial zoning districts.</p>
